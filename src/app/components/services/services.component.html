      <p class="service-content">
        With offices in Toronto and Baghdad, we offer a comprehensive range of
        services at every stage of film creation in both Iraq and Canada. Whether
        you're envisioning a sprawling feature film or a snappy short, we are
        adept at guiding your cinematic journey through the enchanting landscapes
        of Canada and the echoes of Sumer and Babylon in Iraq. At Purattu, we
        extend a warm welcome to individual artists as well as established film
        production companies and studios. Our approach is personalised, adapting
        to the unique requirements of each project and the needs of content
        producers. From the inception of creative ideas in writing rooms to full
        production services, picture editing, and DCP. Majority of our projects
        are treaty and non-treaty international co-productions. We aid content
        producers in navigating the intricacies of Canadian tax incentives, as
        well as applications to the funding programs of the Canadian Heritage and
        a variety of funds in the MENA region.
